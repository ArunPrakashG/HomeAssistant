### Contributions
This project was started as my hobby project, just so that i could learn more of C# and .NET Framework and work with Linux commands and get familier with Raspian system. I always try my best to write the best code i can write as far as my knowledge go, if you feel you can improve a certain part of the code, feel free to send a pull request, with the specification on how i can improve the part so that i can correct myself for future codes i write!
